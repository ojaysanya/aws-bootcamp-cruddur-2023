#Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile

#Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces

#Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
